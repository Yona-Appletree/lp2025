# Cranelift Fork - Cursor Rules

# Warnings: Fix warnings before committing. Don't just ignore them. If you can't fix them easily, ask for help.

# Commits: Commit frequently with small incremental changes

# Commits: Keep commit messages short (one line when possible)

# Commits: Keep code compiling and tests passing between commits (when possible)

# Style: Follow existing cranelift code style

# Style: Use `#![no_std]` where appropriate

# Style: Gate std-dependent code behind features

# Structure: Keep cranelift fork clean for potential upstream merges

# Structure: Use feature flags to gate optional components

# Structure: Keep wasmtime components but gate behind features (Option 1 approach)
